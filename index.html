<p>For this seminar to be as useful as possible to everyone, it is important we establish the right "seminar culture." This of course is not something that is carved in stone but instead it will shift and evolve over time. However, there are some simple guidelines for what we are trying to accomplish:</p>

<p><li>Attendees are willing to learn and to help others learn. They should not come in order to demonstrate how much smarter they are than everyone else just because they know so much more about a specific topic.</li></p>
<p><li>Active listening is encouraged. Ask questions! In particular, while research questions are of course welcome, basic comprehension questions are especially encouraged. If you don't understand something, or if you don't believe a step in a proof, ask!</li></p>
<p><li>One important point: no question is too stupid to ask. This places an obligation on other members of the seminar: rather than express frustration at the basic nature of a question, look at it as an opportunity to practice your skills in explaining things.</li></p>
<p><li>Of course, while active listening is a good thing, we want to avoid having a few people fill the communications channel. So, please be considerate of the other people present and allow them to join the discussions as well.</li></p>
