<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Data Science Research (DSR) Lab Knowledge Sharing Sesion.</h3>

<p></p>The Data Science Institute is a research center based in the Faculty of Computing & Informatics, Multimedia University. The Institute was formed following the members' collaboration in a Twitter mining project for market sentiment analysis in October 2013.

The members of the Data Science Institute comprise of expertise across faculties such as Faculty of Computing and Informatics, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Management and Faculty of Information Science and Technology. Members conduct research in leading data science areas including stream mining, video analytics, machine learning, next generation data visualization and advanced data modelling; regardless of size of data, big or small.

The institute also aims to support the industries and government of Malaysia in training data scientists.
The Data Science Institute envisions itself to be a leading partner for solving complex real-world data problems.</p>

<p>For this seminar to be as useful as possible to everyone, it is important we establish the right "seminar culture." This is, of course, something that is something carved in stone but instead it will shift and evolve. However, there are some simple guidelines for what we are trying to accomplish:

<li>Attendees are willing to learn and to help others learn. They should not come in order to demonstrate how much smarter they are than everyone else just because they know so much more about a specific topic.</li>
<li>Active listening is encouraged. Ask questions! In particular, while research questions are of course welcome, basic comprehension questions are especially encouraged. If you don't understand something, or if you don't believe a step in a proof, ask!</li>
<li>One important point: no question is too stupid to ask. This places an obligation on other members of the seminar: rather than express frustration at the basic nature of a question, look at it as an opportunity to practice your skills in explaining things.</li>
<li>Of course, while active listening is a good thing, we want to avoid having a few people fill the communications channel. So, please be considerate of the other people present and allow them to join the discussions as well.</li>
</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
